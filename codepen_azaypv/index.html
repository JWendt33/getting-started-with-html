<h1>Udacity Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>

<b>Where to begin</b>
<p>The worldwide web is a collection of HTML docs. The links between these pages is what makes the web <em>web-like</em>.</p>

<b>Major pieces of the web:</b>
<br>
<br>
- You: a person.<br>
- Your Computer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"> probably this</a>.<br>
- Web Browser: A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. <br>
- The Internet: The world's largest computer network. Invented by <a href="https://breakingbird.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/al-gore.jpg"> Al Gore</a>.<br> 
- Servers: Computers that host the files that make up the web<br>
- HTTP - the main protocol of the web<br>
<br>
Here is a <a href="https://www.udacity.com"> video</a> that explains how all of the above go together. 
<br>
<br>

<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<br>
HTML = <em>HyperText Markup Language</em><br>
<br>
It's considered the heart of the web. It's made up of: 
<br>
<br>

<em>Text content</em>: what you see<br>
<em>Markup</em>: what it looks like<br>
<em>References to documents</em>: e.g. images + videos<br>
<em>Links to other pages</em>:<a href="https://www.udacity.com"> Like this!</a><br>
<br>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<br>

<p>HTML markup consists of opening tags, closing tags, and contents. All of that combines into an "element." Here is a link to a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video</a> that discusses this in more detail. </p>

<p>Elements can either be <em>in-line</em> or <em>block</em>.  Block
  elements create an "invisible box" around the content that sits inside of
  them.</p>

<b>5 most important take-aways from this lesson</b>
<br>

<p>1. What a web page is: A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents and then interpret and display them.</p> 
<p>2. How coding works: Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</p>
<p>3. Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct “syntax”).</p>
<p>4. Programmers can’t remember everything: There are too many details to keep everything in your head.</p> 
<p>5. Basic HTML vocabulary: A <em>tag</em> is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called “<b>void</b>” tags) do not require a closing tag. 
An HTML <em>element</em> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. 
Lastly, an <em>attribute</em> is a property of an HTML element.</p>
